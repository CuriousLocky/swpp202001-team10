This is Team 10's code repo of the course project for [Principles and Practices of Software Development](https://github.com/snu-sf-class/swpp202001) @ [Seoul National University](https://en.snu.ac.kr/).

Project collaborators are Jasmine Abt, Alfiya ([alphy1](https://github.com/alphy1)), Hexiang Geng ([CuriousLocky](https://github.com/CuriousLocky)) and Minghang Li ([Matchy](https://github.com/matchy233)).

## Commit Message Conventions

There are two popular ways of writing a commit message: [Tim Pope style](https://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html) (This is also recommended in the official guideline of Git, [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Distributed-Git-Contributing-to-a-Project)), and the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) style. The latter one is preferred in many large open-source projects since it dovetails [SemVer](https://semver.org/). Here we adopt the Tim Pope style, for it's succinctness.

Here are the 7 rules for writing a good Tim Pope style commit message:

1. Limit the subject line to 50 characters.
2. Capitalize *only* the first letter in the subject line.
3. *Don't* put a period at the end of the subject line.
4. Put a blank line between the subject line and the body.
5. Wrap the body at 72 characters.
6. Use the imperative mood, but not past tense.
7. Describe *what* was done and why, but not *how*.

Read [this nice blog post](https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/) for explanation on why we set up those rules.
